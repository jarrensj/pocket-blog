Saturation Point? What’s Next for Pokémon Pocket
Maintaining
After 8 months, Pokémon Pocket does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon, but it is nowhere near the same game it was back then.
The old meta days of simple Rock, Paper, Scissors between Mewtwo EX/Gardevoir, Moltres EX/Charizard EX, or Pikachu EX decks are over. The game evolved into more of a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock format with Darkrai, Giratina, Lycanroc, Rampardos, and Gyarados EX.
(For those who don’t get that:
Rock crushes Lizard and Scissors.
Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock.
Scissors cut Paper and decapitate Lizard.
Lizard poisons Spock and eats Paper.
Spock smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock.)
Each of these decks served their purpose, capable of swinging heavy by turn five, assuming you had a good starting hand and could find your evolutions.

Rare Candy Epidemic
The meta of heavy hitters with slow builds hit a brick wall with the introduction of Rare Candy, bringing the game into a new era: heavy hitters and a lucky hand.
By removing the need for Stage 1s and skipping the extra turn required to evolve, players could now potentially have their main attacker online and swinging by turn two.
The most notorious offender? Solgaleo EX, who could swing for 120 damage without needing to retreat your active Pokémon.
Yes, Rare Candy enables Charizard EX, Meowscarada, or Rampardos to evolve quickly too, but they usually still require a retreat, wasting one more turn and an energy. That was not the case for the sun cat, and it terrorized competitive leagues.
While other decks remained viable, games often came down to the luck of the draw.

Sylveon EX: The Deck Thinner
Now, we’re facing another turning point in the game. The meta has received a new engine.
We went from heavy hitters with slow builds,
to heavy hitters with a lucky hand,
to simply... heavy hitters.
At first glance, Sylveon EX looked like a huge buff for Psychic decks, with 70 damage and a strong ability. But quickly, it started being used strictly as a deck-thinning engine.
No longer needing much luck, a player can now draw 4 to 8 cards on turn two just by:
* Evolving two Eevees,

* Using a Professor’s Research,

* Playing Poké Balls and thinning through items.

This nearly guarantees they’ll find their basics, Rare Candy, Stage 2s, and key supporters. If the setup is already on board, they’re swinging hard by turn two.
Current meta looks like this:
   * Giratina/Greninja with Sylveon EX

   * Charizard EX with Sylveon EX

   * Leafeon EX/Flareon EX with Sylveon EX

   * Solgaleo EX with Sylveon EX

   * Primarina EX with Sylveon EX

   * Garchomp EX with Sylveon EX

With players now able to be competitive using nearly any energy type, where do we go from here?

The Forgotten Dragons
Right now, players can build a deck around almost any type of heavy hitter. With Rare Candy and Sylveon EX, there is not much more that can be done to increase reliability.
This is exactly why, even after all this time, Dragon decks still don’t work.
In a game that already relies on luck and coin flips, who wants to add the extra gamble of needing to draw not only the right cards, but also multiple types of energy?
Dual-energy decks often brick. The number of games lost to pulling only one type of energy is way too high, especially at the competitive level.
So what changes that?
I believe the next major shift in the meta will come from the introduction of a:
      * Trainer,

      * Item, or

      * Ability
 that fixes the energy problem.

The most obvious fix? A Lance-style Supporter that lets you:
         * Change an energy attached to a Dragon-type Pokémon, or

         * More generally, convert one energy in your energy zone to any type.

The first option breathes life into cards like Dragonite (EX and non-EX), Garchomp, and Necrozma EX.
The second would be a full-blown shake-up, allowing for hybrid typing and wild new combos.

Final Thoughts
I just felt like trying this writing thing and doing something with the game I’m probably spending too much time on.
Possible counters to all this? Sure. People will mention Mars Card and Red Card, but those are luck-based too. Your opponent can still pull everything they need the very next turn.
Another option? “Just play meta decks.”
Yeah, I would.
If I could.
As someone who actually spends a little money on the game and still can’t pull a second Sylveon EX, it’s not that simple.
Next up, I’ll probably dive into some deck analysis, meta commentary, or explore what kind of builds we might see with the current card pool.
