**Capitalizing on the Brick: Beating Efficiency with Efficiency**

Alright, so my last post definitely had a bit of cope regarding Sylveon EX. After never pulling a second one, I went into a full hater arc about the RNG of the game. Once I finally drew that second Sylveon EX, I realized those complaints were just excuses for not adapting, which was loser talk.

After pulling both Sylveons, I tried running the meta deck. This quickly led to mirror matches and games decided purely by luck. Jumping into the meta this late in the season was a guaranteed way to stay one step behind.

At the end of the day, this is a competitive card game rooted in strategy. Instead of complaining about pull rates or metas, winners adapt. They find the angle that breaks the mold and creates the next meta killer.

For those unfamiliar with the current Eevee Grove meta, the dominant deck features Giratina EX, Sylveon EX, and Greninja, holding a 14 percent share in recorded tournaments according to LimitlessTCG. This list functions with near-perfect synergy. With 2 Sylveon EX, 2 Professor's Research, and 2 Poké Balls, the deck can draw anywhere from 2 to 8 cards by turn 2. That level of draw nearly guarantees setup, leading to game control through Water Shuriken chip damage and Cyrus control.

Greninja's 20 chip damage combined with Tina's 130 swing allows for clean one-shots on most tanks. Altogether, this deck blends chip damage, heavy hitters, and deck thinning into a highly efficient threat that punishes slower setups.

At first, the counterplay seemed obvious: slow them down with Mars or Red Card. While logical in theory, this strategy depends on adding more chance into a game already full of it. There are too many risks. You might never draw your Mars or Red Card in time, or worse, you might shuffle your opponent into exactly what they need. For example, they might not have a Rare Candy in hand, but after using Mars, their next turn could include a Cape on Tina, a Greninja evolution, and a well-timed Cyrus to clear your board.

In the end, it meant gambling two card slots on a possibility. That's when new decks began emerging with a different philosophy, which I call **Capitalizing on the Brick**.

Rather than trying to disrupt the opponent's setup by chance, these decks focus on hyper-consistency and low brick probability. The idea is simple. If the opponent has even the slightest stumble in their starting hand, you're already applying pressure. You can remove a key basic like Froakie or Eevee by turn one or two, taking out one of their central value engines before it even gets started.

### Two Decks That Capitalize on the Brick

**Fighting Deck: Rampardos / Garchomp EX / Sylveon EX**  
The Rampardos line only requires 1 energy. A good starting hand can allow you to retreat your Gible or Eevee and swing with Cranidos for 50, or with Rare Candy, swing with Rampardos for 130. This damage can immediately knock out an Eevee or bring Giratina into one-shot range. Since Giratina has recoil, it cannot attack the following turn if you land the first hit. Rampardos also makes for a perfect follow-up once Tina swings and sits at 130 HP.

**Electric Deck: Zeraora / Silvally / Oricorio**  
A Dawn and Zeraora combo enables you to power up Silvally by turn 2 and hit for 100. Starting with Oricorio or Zeraora and playing a Giovanni lets you swing for 60 on turn 2, either knocking out Froakie or Eevee or dropping Tina to 100 HP for an easy cleanup.

The Fighting Deck stands out because it only runs 2 Professor Oak and 2 Lillie as Supporters. Every other slot is committed to drawing Pokémon, guaranteeing that you always have a bench or evolution play lined up. The Electric Deck leans into quick pivots and consistent pressure. It lacks raw damage but makes up for it with energy flexibility and tempo.

Both decks sacrifice top-end power for reliability. In a format where most games are decided by turn 3, consistency becomes more important than flash.

When you only have a few meaningful turns, there is no time to gamble. You need to control tempo, punish slow starts, and make sure your engine is always online. Give yourself the best odds. Don't wait for your opponent to brick but get ahead of them before they can even set up.
