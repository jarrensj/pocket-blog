# Saturation Point? What’s Next for Pokémon Pocket

## Maintaining

After 8 months, **Pokémon Pocket** does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon, but it is nowhere near the same game it was back then.

The old meta days of simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** between Mewtwo EX/Gardevoir, Moltres EX/Charizard EX, or Pikachu EX decks are over. The game then evolved into more of a **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock** format with Darkrai, Giratina, Lycanroc, Rampardos, and Gyarados EX.

> (For those who don’t get that:  
> Rock crushes Lizard and Scissors.  
> Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock.  
> Scissors cut Paper and decapitate Lizard.  
> Lizard poisons Spock and eats Paper.  
> Spock smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock.)

Each of these decks served their purpose, capable of swinging heavy by the fifth turn or so, assuming you had a good starting hand and could find your evolutions.

## Rare Candy Epidemic

The meta of heavy hitters with slow builds hit a brick wall with the introduction of **Rare Candy**, bringing the game into a new era: **heavy hitters and a lucky hand**.

By removing the need for Stage 1s and skipping the extra turn required to evolve, players could now potentially have their heavy hitters online and swinging by **turn two**.

The most notable of these was **Solgaleo EX**, capable of swinging for 120 without needing to retreat your active Pokémon.

Although Rare Candy enables players to get **Charizard EX**, **Meowscarada**, or **Rampardos** up by turn two, they typically still need to retreat into them, which wastes a turn and energy. This was not the case for the sun cat, and it terrorized competitive leagues.

While other decks remained viable and competitive, games often came down to **the luck of the draw**.

## Sylveon EX: The Deck Thinner

Now, we are facing another turning point in the game where the meta has received a new engine.

We went from heavy hitters with slow builds,  
to heavy hitters with a lucky hand,  
to simply... **heavy hitters**.

At first glance, **Sylveon EX** looked like a huge buff for Psychic decks with a solid 70 damage and a strong ability, but quickly, it started being used strictly as a **deck-thinning engine**.

No longer needing much luck, a player can now draw **4 to 8 cards on turn two** by evolving both **Eevees**, using a **Professor’s Research**, and playing **Poké Balls** to thin their deck.

This nearly guarantees they will draw their **basics**, **Rare Candy**, **Stage 2s**, and **supporters**, giving them the perfect setup or, if their basic is already on the board, the ability to start swinging heavy right away.

The current meta as it stands:

- **Giratina/Greninja** with Sylveon EX
- **Charizard EX** with Sylveon EX
- **Leafeon EX/Flareon EX** with Sylveon EX
- **Solgaleo EX** with Sylveon EX
- **Primarina EX** with Sylveon EX
- **Garchomp EX** with Sylveon EX

With players now having the option to be competitive with nearly any energy type, **where do we go next?**

## The Forgotten Dragons

As it stands, a player can choose a heavy hitter from almost any type to build a deck around. With **Rare Candy** and **Sylveon EX**, there is not much more that can be done to make those decks more reliable.

This brings us to the issue of **reliability and consistency**, which is exactly why, even after all this time, **Dragon decks still do not work**.

In a game based on luck and coin flips, why would anyone gamble their match on the hope of pulling not only the right cards, but also the right types of energy?

The amount of times dual-energy decks have bricked by only drawing one energy type is one too many, especially in competitive play.

That is why I believe the next meta of Pokémon Pocket will come from the introduction of an **item**, **trainer**, or **ability** that **fixes the energy issue**.

The most obvious idea is a **Lance-style Supporter** that lets you:

- Change an energy attached to a Dragon-type Pokémon
- Or more generally, convert one of your energy cards in the energy zone to any type

The former would bring Dragons into the mix, breathing life into **Dragonite (EX and non-EX)**, **regular Garchomp**, or **Necrozma EX**.

The latter would be a complete meta shake-up, enabling **cross-type decks** and **new combo lines**.

## Final Thoughts

I just felt like trying this writing thing and doing something with the game I am probably spending too much time on.

**Possible counters?**  
Yeah, people will say **Mars Card** and **Red Card**, but those are also luck-based plays. The opponent can still miraculously pull the cards they need anyway.

**Another option?**  
Just play meta decks.  
Well yeah, I would if I could. As someone who puts some money into the game and still cannot pull a second **Sylveon EX**, it is not that simple.

I will probably do some deck analysis, meta commentary, or go more in-depth on what kind of builds we could see with the existing card pool.
